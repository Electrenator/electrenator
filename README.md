## Hello there, I'm Liera üêâ

I'm a final year computer science student driven by curiosity. Currently I'm working on and off on random projects. Sometimes I'm making small collaboration efforts within projects while continuing to learn more about random subjects of interest.  
Most of the time I'm working on finishing my study but I there sometimes is also time left to spend on hobby projects like my homelab, code projects and other self improvements. Recently (as of last date below) I've mainly been working on;
- Furthering my Golang knowledge with smaller projects of mine named [Tabbly](https://github.com/Electrenator/Tabbly) and [Mozilla LZ4 decoder](https://gitlab.com/electrenator/mozilla-lz4-decoder) together with smaller non-public API test trials.
- Some diving into post-quantum cryptography and the quantum internet;
- Bit of dabbling into the Minecraft modding scene;
- Slight bit of experimentation with browser extensions.

*GitHub isn't where all repositories I work on are kept, so the statistics here don't represent everything I do.*
