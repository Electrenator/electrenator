## Hello there, I'm Liera üêâ

I'm a final year computer science student driven by curiosity. Currently I'm working on and off on random projects. Sometimes making small collaboration efforts within projects while continuing to learn more about random subjects.  
Mostly working on finishing my study but also work on random projects, my homelab and some other hobbies. Recently (as of last date below) I've mainly been working on;
- Trying out Golang;
- Some quantum programming;
- Bit of dabbling into the Minecraft modding scene.

*GitHub isn't where all repositories I work on are kept, so the statistics here don't represent everything I do.*
